### **3\. Communication and Issue Resolution**

* **Primary Communication Channel:** Dedicated group chat (e.g., Slack or WhatsApp) for **daily status updates** and **immediate questions**.  
* **Asynchronous Issue Tracking:** **Git/Code Repository Issues** will be used to formally document, assign, and track technical bugs and tasks.  
* **Weekly Check-in Meetings:** **Video conference calls** (e.g., every Sunday evening) will be held to review progress, demonstrate features, and address blocked tasks.

#### **Issue Resolution Process**

1. **Delayed Tasks:** The responsible team member must immediately notify the group chat. The task will be prioritized for discussion at the next daily or weekly check-in. The team will decide if the task needs to be **reassigned** or if **assistance** should be provided by another member (e.g., Mohammad Slim for implementation blocks).  
2. **Unfulfilled Assignments:** If a team member is blocked or unable to complete a task, they will alert the team leader/scope planner (**Adam Belhadj** or **Seif Awad**). The team will then collectively **re-assign** or **split** the task during the weekly meeting to ensure the project timeline stays on track.
